# DBSCAN-Improvement
This repository houses some of the datasets we used to test our new implementation of the DBSCAN algorithm against its traditional counterpart.  Our contribution was introducing a dynamic epsilon hyperparameter calculation.  A full writeup of the algorithm, how it works, and our results can be found in the following document:

Note that one of the datasets used is imported from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, while the other is accessible in python and is listed in the relating Jupyter notebooks.
